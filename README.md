# Multa
An experimental server-side application for board games.

### What does multa mean?
multa /Ëˆmulta/ means "multiple" in latin. We choose this name because we are developing a multiplayer game server.

### Current plan
As mentioned above, this is just an experimental application. We have not decided the specific game to develop yet. We even may not develop board games. This is just for fun!

### Documentation
To be done.

### General idea & guide
please refer to [this article](https://medium.com/u2i-blogs/we-made-a-multiplayer-browser-game-in-go-for-fun-242a5990ce29)

### Language
We are using Golang for this project.

#### Reason
Golang is a rather new language, but is really suitable for multi-processing. This language has its embedded multi-processing support (Goroutine and Channel). In short, Goroutine is to create a new process and the cost is very cheap. Channel is used for inter-process communication.
